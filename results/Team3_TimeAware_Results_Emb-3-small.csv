conventional_player_9,Joseph Martinez,The Conventional Player,NO,2021-02-25,"While the story and graphics of Cyberpunk 2077 received high praise, the overall consensus seems to indicate significant issues with gameplay and bugs, which are major turn-offs for me. The mixed reviews highlight that despite its immersive environment and art style, the game feels incomplete and doesn't deliver on its promises regarding player choice. Additionally, the mention of constant crashes and the need to disable features like raytracing suggests a lack of polish that I typically avoid in games. Given my preference for familiar and reliable titles, I don't think this game aligns with my interests."
conventional_player_12,Michael Martinez,The Conventional Player,NO,2021-02-25,"Despite some positive aspects like a gripping story and immersive environment, the reviews highlight significant issues such as bugs, graphics inconsistencies, and a lack of meaningful choices in gameplay.

Additionally, the excitement generated by the Edgerunners anime seems to have rekindled interest in the game, leading to a more favorable reception among players who previously had negative experiences. Overall, it seems worth trying out now."

The reviews suggest that if approached with tempered expectations, players can find enjoyment in the game's atmosphere and storytelling. Given my balanced approach to gaming and interest in various genres, I believe I can appreciate the game's redeeming qualities while being mindful of its shortcomings."

The character development and side quests are well-crafted, making it a worthwhile experience for a passionate gamer like myself. The positive aspects outweigh the negatives, making it a solid purchase."
backseat_gamer_2,Linda Johnson,The Backseat Gamer,NO,2022-02-01,"The reviews indicate that 'Cyberpunk 2077' has been plagued by extreme hype and poor management, resulting in a game that fails to meet expectations. While some players have found enjoyment in the game, they acknowledge its shortcomings and the disappointment surrounding its launch. The criticisms focus on the game's inability to deliver on its promises, despite having redeeming qualities like its soundtrack and art direction. Given the mixed feedback and the acknowledgment that it may not be worth the investment, I would recommend against buying it."
ultimate_gamer_6,Sarah Miller,The Ultimate Gamer,NO,2020-12-24,"While there are some positive aspects mentioned in the reviews, such as a well-written main quest line, memorable characters, and a breathtaking open world, the game is currently plagued by significant issues. Several reviews highlight game-breaking glitches, unsatisfying gunplay, and an underwhelming crafting system. Additionally, the recommendation against purchasing it at the current price of $60 suggests that the game is not in a good state right now. Given the mixed feedback and the potential for future improvements, it would be wise to wait for patches and a more stable experience before making a purchase."

Additionally, quality of life improvements have been noted, especially for those who experienced issues during the initial launch. The consensus indicates that it is now a highly enjoyable game, making it a worthwhile purchase."
all_round_enthusiast_4,Jessica Williams,The All-Round Enthusiast,NO,2020-12-31,"While there are some positive aspects mentioned about 'Cyberpunk 2077,' such as the enjoyment of exploring Night City and the potential for engaging gameplay, the overwhelming consensus in the reviews indicates significant issues with bugs and performance, especially on older consoles. Many reviewers express disappointment with the game's length and feel that it was rushed and unfinished. Given these concerns, especially about the game's stability and the need for high-end hardware, it may be wise to hold off on purchasing until these issues are resolved."

conventional_player_2,Jessica Johnson,The Conventional Player,NO,2023-12-01,"While the reviews indicate that 'Cyberpunk 2077' has improved significantly since its troubled launch, the game still seems to have a mixed reception. Although some players find it a great experience now, others mention ongoing issues and a lack of certain content. As someone who prefers familiar games and may not be interested in navigating potential pitfalls, I would likely pass on this title for now."
