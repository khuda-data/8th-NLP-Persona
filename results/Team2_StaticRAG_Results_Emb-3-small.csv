cloud_gamer_11,Mary Jones,The Cloud Gamer,NO,2022-08-01,"The reviews indicate significant technical issues with 'Cyberpunk 2077', including severe lag, frequent crashes, bugs, and texture loading problems. As a cloud gamer who prefers smoother experiences, these persistent issues would likely hinder my enjoyment of the game. Until these problems are addressed through patches and optimizations, it seems unwise to make a purchase."
conventional_player_10,Linda Smith,The Conventional Player,NO,2023-06-01,"The reviews indicate that 'Cyberpunk 2077' has a history of game-breaking bugs, which is a significant concern. Even though there are some positive reviews suggesting it is better than initially thought, the repeated mention of bugs raises red flags for me. I prefer to stick with familiar games that are known to be stable and enjoyable."
popcorn_gamer_2,Charles Miller,The Popcorn Gamer,YES,2020-12-10,"The reviews highlight an engaging story and an amazing atmosphere, which are crucial for a game that I would want to watch on Twitch or YouTube.

Although there is mention of improved performance after patch 1.23, the earlier reviews highlight a consistent trend of poor performance, particularly on high-end hardware as well.

time_filler_1,Richard Johnson,The Time Filler,NO,2021-01-28,"While some reviews mention good gameplay and interesting characters, there are also significant concerns about bugs and the overall experience not meeting expectations.

time_filler_3,Thomas Jones,The Time Filler,NO,2021-01-28,"While some reviews indicate that 'Cyberpunk 2077' meets expectations and offers a satisfying experience, there are mixed feelings about the game's depth and creativity. One review highlights that if you're looking for a game similar to GTA with a cyberpunk theme, you might enjoy it, but if you're expecting something more imaginative, it may not meet those expectations. Given that I'm just looking for a casual time-filler and not something overly complex or demanding, it seems like this game might not align with my interests."
time_filler_13,Joseph Johnson,The Time Filler,NO,2020-12-10,"While there are some positive reviews praising the game's personality and overall experience, the recurring issue of bugs and the need to frequently reload saves raises significant concerns.

The potential frustration with technical issues outweighs the appeal of the game's content at this time."

This suggests that despite the graphics, the gameplay and world-building may not meet expectations.

all_round_enthusiast_4,Patricia Brown,The All-Round Enthusiast,YES,2020-12-17,"Despite the presence of bugs and glitches mentioned in several reviews, the overall sentiment towards 'Cyberpunk 2077' is positive. Reviewers highlight the game's enjoyable story, beautiful design, and engaging gameplay mechanics. The minor issues seem to be common in new releases and can be expected to be addressed in future updates. The strong narrative and world-building make it a worthwhile purchase for someone looking for a balanced gaming experience."
all_round_enthusiast_5,John Rodriguez,The All-Round Enthusiast,NO,2021-10-01,"While the reviews mention solid mechanics, beautiful design, and a good story, they also highlight significant issues such as bugs, glitches, and a weird melee system. The description of enemies turning invisible and quests being glitchy raises concerns about the game's overall stability and enjoyment. Given these drawbacks, it seems that the game's potential enjoyment is hampered by its current state, making it a risky purchase."
ultimate_gamer_2,Michael Garcia,The Ultimate Gamer,NO,2023-07-01,"The reviews from 2021 regarding 'Cyberpunk 2077' indicate significant issues with the game. While there are mentions of quality, the context of the reviews suggests that the game faced major problems at launch, particularly highlighted in reviews from February 2021. Given the game's rocky start and ongoing concerns about performance and bugs, it would be wise to hold off on purchasing until more recent reviews confirm that these issues have been resolved."

One reviewer expresses disappointment with CDPR, stating they wouldn't recommend the game in its current state despite its soul and flare. The overall sentiment leans towards dissatisfaction, suggesting that it may not be worth purchasing at this time."
ultimate_gamer_4,Sarah Smith,The Ultimate Gamer,NO,2022-09-13,"The reviews indicate a significant divide in opinions about 'Cyberpunk 2077'. While some praise its graphics and potential, there are multiple comments highlighting it as an overhyped game with a lack of depth and a living world. The negative reviews particularly emphasize that it feels like an empty shell, which is a major concern for someone who values immersive gameplay. Given these issues, it seems wise to refrain from purchasing this game."
time_filler_5,Richard Martinez,The Time Filler,NO,2021-10-01,"While one review mentions enjoying the game due to its open city and compelling quests, there are multiple reviews suggesting to wait for a sale, indicating that the game might not be worth the full price at this time. Additionally, the mention of occasional glitches and improbable physics raises concerns about the game's overall quality. Given these factors, it seems prudent to hold off on purchasing Cyberpunk 2077 right now."
